                We envision an environment where computational best practices, innovative solutions, and expert knowledge combine to build advanced tools for research and to enable new discoveries. Our mission is to provide the scientific and technical computing expertise required to advance computational research and support Brownâ€™s academic mission. In practice, this frequently means partnering with researchers for projects that may span weeks, months, or years. In some cases, these partnerships can involve researchers using grant funds as partial support of one of our research software engineers or data scientists. We have a team of data scientists and research software engineers with a huge variety of scientific backgrounds (e.g., Engineering, Physics, Computer Vision, Biology, Psychology, Statistics, Applied Math, Computer Science, etc.), so we can closely calibrate a person with a project.

              CCV embraces a community enriched and enhanced by diverse dimensions, including race, ethnicity and national origins, disability status, gender and gender identity, sexuality, class and religion. We believe diversity brings innovation and progress. We are especially committed to increasing the representation of those populations that have been historically underrepresented in STEM.

              We are committed to attracting, recruiting and retaining a diverse team. We especially encourage individuals from underrepresented groups to join our community.
