                  The Center for Computation and Visualization (CCV) is a center within the University's central IT organization, which is the Office of Information Technology (OIT). In addition to building and maintaining the University's hundreds of enterprise software, systems, and hardware, OIT is also responsible for driving the technological progress that enables scientific research. Executing on the University's research mission is the key role that CCV plays in OIT.

                  We envision an environment where computational best practices, innovative solutions, and expert knowledge combine to build advanced tools for research and to enable new discoveries. Our mission is to provide the scientific and technical computing expertise required to advance computational research and support Brownâ€™s academic mission. In practice, this frequently means partnering with researchers for projects that may span weeks, months, or years. In some cases, these partnerships can involve researchers using grant funds as partial support of one of our research software engineers or data scientists. We have a team of data scientists and research software engineers with a huge variety of scientific backgrounds (e.g., Engineering, Physics, Computer Vision, Biology, Psychology, Statistics, Applied Math, Computer Science, etc.), so we can closely calibrate a person with a project.
