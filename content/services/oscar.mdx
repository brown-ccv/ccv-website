<ContentSection title="Why Use High-Performance Computing?">
High-Performance Computing (HPC), or supercomputing, is a powerful shared resource that can dramatically accelerate and
expand the scope of your research. Unlike a personal computer with fixed capabilities, an HPC system provides a
customizable and scalable pool of computing resources — processors, memory, and storage — that you can tailor to the
specific needs of your project. This allows you to handle complex computational tasks that would be impossible on a
single machine!

Oscar, CCV's primary research computing cluster, consists of more than 300 multi-core nodes sharing a high-performance
interconnect and file system.

<CardGroup>
  <StyledCard size="lg" iconName="" title="Solve Problems Faster">
    Oscar resources can reduce a calculation that would take months on a personal computer to just hours or minutes.
    This allows you to explore more variables, run more simulations, and get to your results sooner.
  </StyledCard>

  <StyledCard size="lg" iconName="" title="Tackle Larger Problems">
    Oscar can enable you to work with datasets too massive for a standard computer. This is essential for fields
    like genomics, climate modeling, and astrophysics, where the data is measured in terabytes or even petabytes.
  </StyledCard>

  <StyledCard size="lg" iconName="" title="Facilitate Collaboration">
    Oscar provides centralized data storage that is easily accessible to all your collaborators. This eliminates the
    need to transfer large files and ensures everyone is working with the same version of the data, streamlining teamwork.
  </StyledCard>

  <StyledCard size="lg" iconName="" title="Enhance Reproducibility">
    By standardizing the computing environment, Oscar makes your research more reproducible. Your collaborators can run
    the exact same code on the same system, which is crucial for verifying results and publishing your work.
  </StyledCard>

  <StyledCard size="lg" iconName="" title="Run Complex Simulations">
      By providing access to more than 300 multi-core nodes, Oscar allows you to create more detailed and accurate models.
      This is crucial for disciplines that rely on complex simulations, such as drug discovery, fluid dynamics, and material science.
  </StyledCard>

  <StyledCard size="lg" iconName="" title="Open New Research Avenues">
      Access to this kind of computational power can open up entirely new areas of research that were previously out of
      reach. It allows you to ask bigger questions and pursue more ambitious projects.

<ContentSection title="Is Oscar Right for You?">
You don't need to be an expert in computing to use these resources. Consider if any of the following apply to your work:

- Does your research involve large datasets?
- Do you need to run complex simulations or models?
- Does your work require intensive data processing, like image or video analysis?
- Are you collaborating with others on a project that involves a lot of data?
- Do your current computations take a very long time to complete?

If you answered yes to any of these, supercomputing resources could significantly enhance your research capabilities.
CCV is here to help you get started and understand how these powerful tools can be applied to your specific needs.
