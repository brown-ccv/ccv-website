<ContentSection title="In-Class Tutorials" >

CCV offers a variety of tutorials to provide students with experience using Brown's HPC systems. CCV staff members provide students with an overview of the topic and guide them through a series of hands-on activities. Tutorials can range from the basics of using HPC systems to the use of specific applications on Brown's HPC systems.

<ContentSection title="Student Accounts">

CCV provides access to HPC resources for classes, workshops, demonstrations, and other instructional uses. We do ask that you follow these guidelines to help us better support your class.

- Provide at least two week's notice for new account requests and software requests. List all the names and emails of users (students, TAs, instructors) as well as the course number.
- The instructor and/or TA(s) are responsible for all software setup.
- Oscar is a shared resource, so access nodes and speed cannot be guaranteed.

<ContentSection title="Computational Notebooks">

Computational Notebooks provide a convenient, cloud-hosted way to serve Jupyter Notebooks for multiple users. Notebooks are launched within a pre-configured computing environment so that users do not need to install any software packages. This set-up free environment is ideal for courses and workshops where instructors intend for students to begin coding with minimal obstacles. Jupyter's flexibility allows instructors to pick the preferred language for a particular context, including Python, Julia, R and many more.

## Google Colab

Google Colab comes bundled with most Python-specific software libraries, and it supports real-time collaboration. It integrates with Google Drive and should be sufficient for most classroom or workshop needs.

## Brown JupyterLab

For more advanced needs, Brown's JupyterHub may be a good fit for your needs. If you are an instructor, CCV can provide access to JupyterHub for your class or workshop, and Digital Learning and Design (DLD) can assist with integrating computational assignments into curricula. The implementation is supported by Brown OIT; please follow the link below to request an instance for your class. OIT staff will respond to your request to begin the setup process. We ask that requests for JupyterHub be made at least two months in advance of expected course deployment.
