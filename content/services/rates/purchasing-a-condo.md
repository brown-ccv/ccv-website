A condo is an account that gives users priority access to computing resources, specifically CPU cores and GPU resources. Additionally, investigators may purchase condos to grant access to computing resources for others working with them.

**Benefits of Condo Ownership**

- 5 year life cycle - condo resources will be available for a duration of 5 years.
- Access to more cpu cores than purchased - condo will have access to 1.25 times the number of cpu cores purchased for the first 3 years of its life cycle. For the remaining 2 years, condo will have access to the same number of cpu cores purchased.
- Support - CCV staff will install, upgrade and maintain condo hardware throughout its life cycle.
- High job priority - Jobs submitted to a condo have the highest priority to schedule.
