CCV provides access to HPC resources for classes, workshops, demonstrations, and other instructional uses. We do ask that you follow these guidelines to help us better support your class.

* Provide at least two week's notice for new account requests and software requests. List all the names and emails of users (students, TAs, instructors) as well as the course number.
* The instructor and/or TA(s) are responsible for all software setup.
* Oscar is a shared resource, so access nodes and speed cannot be guaranteed.
