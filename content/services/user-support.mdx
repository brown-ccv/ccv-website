  We offer weekly office hours for general and computational biology support.
  
  - The **Center for Computation and Visualization** office hours assists with questions about Brown's research 
  computing resources (Oscar, Stronghold, Globus) and help high-performance computing (HPC) issues.
  - The **Computational Biology Core** office hours provides help with experimental design, data processing pipelines, 
  and data analysis of high-throughput sequencing data. While the group specializes in computational biology, they can 
  assist with general use of HPC systems.
