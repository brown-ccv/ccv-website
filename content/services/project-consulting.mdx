<ContentSection title="Why Work with CCV?">
  Our team at the Center for Computation and Visualization (CCV) is composed of skilled data scientists, research software engineers, and system administrators. We believe in forming meaningful partnerships with researchers, whether your project spans weeks, months, or years. With us, you can expect long-term stability and adaptable support as your research landscape evolves.

  Working with CCV means you can benefit from:
  
    * **Diverse Technical Expertise**: Our team of data scientists, research software engineers, system administrators draws on deep professional experience from industry, public, and academic sectors to deliver fresh perspectives and technical solutions.
    * **Software Engineering Best Practices**: We implement current software engineering best practices to ensure your academic research is not only functional but also reproducible, reliable, and easily maintainable for future collaboration and long-term impact.
    * **Continuous, Long Term Stability**: Our partnerships are built for long-term project stability. We provide continuous support that is not dependent on the academic calendar, providing consistent CCV involvement even as students or post-docs transition out of the lab.
    * **Dynamic Resource Scaling**: We tailor our involvement to your project's needs. We can scale our effort up or down as your research evolves and requirements change.
    * **Flexible Funding**: We facilitate the use of grant funds to secure dedicated staff effort. We can scale effort proportionally with fluctuating budgets, providing financial flexibility.
