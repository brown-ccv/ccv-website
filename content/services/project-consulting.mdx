<ContentSection title="Consulting and Collaborations">
  CCV provides computing infrastructure, consulting, and support to the Brown Community. We have HPC specialists, data scientists, and research software engineers available to work with researchers. We frequently partner with researchers on projects that may span weeks, months, or years. These partnerships can in some cases involve a researcher using grant funds to support one of our data scientists or research software engineers.

  #### Initial Consultation and Exploration
  
  We begin with an initial consultation to gather and define objectives and explore solutions. 
  
  #### Development

  This includes scoping, hands-on development/research, regular touch-points, deliverables, and handoff.

  #### Deliverables, Handoff, and Maintenance

  We provide deliverables and detailed documentation for handoff to your team as well as a maintenance plan to ensure long-term sustainability.

<ContentSection title="Funding Collaborations">
    Our collaborations are primarily supported by grant-funded research projects. We are available to discuss your ideas no matter where you are in the project lifecycle, and we are adept at scaling solutions to meet your specific requirements. We could also help strengthen proposals as well. See our facilities statement.

    **Partial Funding / Funding Match:** We have a limited budget for partial funding depending on need  
    **Full Collaborator Funding:** Effort is fully paid by collaborator
