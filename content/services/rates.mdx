\*GPU Definitions: Std. - QuadroRTX or lower, High-end - Tesla V100

\*\*Quality-of-Service: The maximum number of cores and duration may change based on cluster utilization. HPC Priority account has a Quality-of-Service (QOS) allowing up to 208 cores, 1TB memory, and a total per-job limit of 1,198,080 core-minutes. This allows a 208-core job to run for 96 hours, a 104-core job to run for 192 hours, or 208 1-core jobs to run for 96 hours. Exploratory account has a Quality-of-Service (QOS) allowing up to 2 GPUs and a total of 5760 GPU-minutes. This allows a 2 GPU job to run for 48 hours or 1 GPU job to run for 96 hours.

<ContentSection title="Purchasing a Condo">

A condo is an account that gives users priority access to computing resources, specifically CPU cores and GPU resources. Additionally, investigators may purchase condos to grant access to computing resources for others working with them.

**Benefits of Condo Ownership**

- 5 year life cycle - condo resources will be available for a duration of 5 years.
- Access to more cpu cores than purchased - condo will have access to 1.25 times the number of cpu cores purchased for the first 3 years of its life cycle. For the remaining 2 years, condo will have access to the same number of cpu cores purchased.
- Support - CCV staff will install, upgrade and maintain condo hardware throughout its life cycle.
- High job priority - Jobs submitted to a condo have the highest priority to schedule.

**How to Get Started**

Contact support@ccv.brown.edu to discuss your need and review your purchase options.

<ContentSection title="Pooled Storage Allocations">

We are able to accommodate group payment plans where individual and grant allocations are pooled under an umbrella such as a group, center, department or institute.

**To set up a group payment plan, please provide the following information:**

- A list of researchers in the group
- A list of grants with end dates for any PIs in the group
- Who will handle the invoicing
