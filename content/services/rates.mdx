<ContentSection title="High Performance Computing Cluster (Oscar)">

The number and size of jobs allowed on Oscar vary with both partition and type of user account. 
All Brown users can request a free exploratory account with basic access to a resources on our Batch and GPU partitions.
Researchers with more intensive computing needs can upgrade to priority accounts, which provide access to more GPU & CPU 
cores, memory, walltime and faster start times.

### Batch Partition
The batch partition is designed for high-throughput computing jobs that require many CPU cores. Upgrading to priority accounts
allows users to run larger jobs with more CPU cores, memory, walltime, faster start times, and limited GPUs.

\*__GPU Definitions__: _Std._ - QuadroRTX or lower, _High-End_ - Tesla V100

\*\*__Quality-of-Service__: The maximum number of cores and duration may change based on cluster utilization. 
HPC Priority account has a Quality-of-Service (QOS) allowing up to 208 cores, 1TB memory, and a total per-job limit 
of 1,198,080 core-minutes. This allows a 208-core job to run for 96 hours, a 104-core job to run for 192 hours, or 
208 1-core jobs to run for 96 hours. Exploratory account has a Quality-of-Service (QOS) allowing up to 2 GPUs and a 
total of 5760 GPU-minutes. This allows a 2 GPU job to run for 48 hours or 1 GPU job to run for 96 hours.

<ContentSection title="Purchasing a Condo">

A condo is an account that gives users priority access to computing resources, specifically CPU cores and GPU resources. 
Investigators may purchase condos to share access to computing resources with their team.

### Benefits of Condo Ownership

- 6 year life cycle - condo resources will be available for a duration of 6 years.
- Access to more cpu cores than purchased - condo will have access to 1.25 times the number of cpu cores purchased.
- Support - CCV staff will install, upgrade and maintain condo hardware throughout its life cycle.
- High job priority - Jobs submitted to a condo have the highest priority to schedule.
