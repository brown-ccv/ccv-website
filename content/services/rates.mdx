<ContentSection title="High Performance Computing Cluster (Oscar)" id="hpc">

The number and size of jobs allowed on Oscar vary with both partition and type of user account.
All Brown users can request a free exploratory account with basic access to a resources on our Batch and GPU partitions.
Researchers with more intensive computing needs can upgrade to priority accounts, which provide access to more GPU & CPU
cores, memory, walltime and faster start times.

### Batch Partition
The _batch_ partition is designed for high-throughput computing jobs that require many CPU cores. Upgrading to priority
accounts allows users to run larger jobs with more CPU cores, memory, walltime, faster start times, and limited
standard GPUs.

### GPU Partition
The _gpu_ partition is designed for jobs that prioritize GPUs. The nodes are equipped with our standard GPUs such as
NVIDIA Quadro RTX or A5000. This partition is ideal for standard parallel workloads, model training, and GPU-accelerated
visualization. Upgrading to priority accounts allows users to run larger jobs with more GPU & CPU cores, memory,
walltime and faster start times.

### High-End GPU Partition
The _gpu-he_ partition provides access to GPUs with higher memory and compute performance such as NVIDIA Tesla V100 or
A6000 GPUs. Recommended for large-scale deep learning, molecular dynamics, and scientific simulations requiring high
memory or compute throughput.

<CardGroup>
  <StyledCard title="High-End GPU" size="md" headerColor="premium">
    - **Partition:** gpu-he
    - **CPU Cores:** 24
    - **Memory:** 256 GB

    - **Max Resource Walltime:** 96hr\*
    - **Cost:** $133/month

Note, these values are subject to periodic review and changes. For more technical details, review the [system hardware
documentation](https://docs.ccv.brown.edu/oscar/system-overview).

\*__Max Resource Walltime:__ The time limit when using the maximum of available CPUs or GPUs of an account.
Using less of the allotted CPUs or GPUs allows for longer walltimes. This is because the resource allocation is
actually governed by a fixed total compute budget measured in CPU-minutes or GPU-minutes that is distributed
across your concurrent jobs. For example, HPC Priority accounts have a compute budget of 19,968 core-hours. Using all
208 cores results in a walltime of 96 hours (19,968 / 208); however using half of the available cores with 104 CPUs
would result in double the walltime at 192 hours (19,968 / 104).

<ContentSection title="Purchasing a Condo" id="condo">

A condo is an account that gives users priority access to computing resources, specifically CPU cores and GPU resources. 
Investigators may purchase condos to share access to computing resources with their team.

### Benefits of Condo Ownership

- 6 year life cycle - condo resources will be available for a duration of 6 years.
- Access to more cpu cores than purchased - condo will have access to 1.25 times the number of cpu cores purchased.
- Support - CCV staff will install, upgrade and maintain condo hardware throughout its life cycle.
- High job priority - Jobs submitted to a condo have the highest priority to schedule.
