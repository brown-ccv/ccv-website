\*GPU Definitions: Std. - QuadroRTX or lower, High-end - Tesla V100

\*\*Quality-of-Service: The maximum number of cores and duration may change based on cluster utilization. HPC Priority account has a Quality-of-Service (QOS) allowing up to 208 cores, 1TB memory, and a total per-job limit of 1,198,080 core-minutes. This allows a 208-core job to run for 96 hours, a 104-core job to run for 192 hours, or 208 1-core jobs to run for 96 hours. Exploratory account has a Quality-of-Service (QOS) allowing up to 2 GPUs and a total of 5760 GPU-minutes. This allows a 2 GPU job to run for 48 hours or 1 GPU job to run for 96 hours.

<ContentSection title="Purchasing a Condo">

A condo is an account that gives users priority access to computing resources, specifically CPU cores and GPU resources. 
Investigators may purchase condos to share access to computing resources with their team.

### Benefits of Condo Ownership

- 6 year life cycle - condo resources will be available for a duration of 6 years.
- Access to more cpu cores than purchased - condo will have access to 1.25 times the number of cpu cores purchased.
- Support - CCV staff will install, upgrade and maintain condo hardware throughout its life cycle.
- High job priority - Jobs submitted to a condo have the highest priority to schedule.

### Additional Research Storage
Additional research storage is available either through a free allocation per active grant 
or on a pay-as-you-go basis. A complementary 10TB additional storage is granted per active grant.
Purchased storage is available in two types: unreplicated (a single copy) or replicated 
(multiple copies at different locations).
