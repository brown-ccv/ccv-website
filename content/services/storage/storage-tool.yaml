  This tool lets you compare the available storage options at Brown.
  Answer some of these questions or select services to compare their features
  and decide which of these services suit your needs.

services:
  - name: "Google Drive"
    description: |
      Google Drive gives you space to store and share documents. The native Google document formats allow for real-time collaboration and file history. You can also store unconverted files of various types in your Google Drive. It's easy to share files with members of the Brown community (including Google Groups) and non-Brown Google accounts; files can be shared with view-only, comment, or edit access.
      
      Google also has a really nice feature where you can scan in handwritten documents and have them converted to text. You can access files on the web, through a mobile app, or by installing Google Drive on your computer (which makes it act like a folder on your computer).
      
      - Best for: Collaboration in native Google files, easy access from anywhere, small amount of total storage, sharing with Google Groups.
      - Limitations: Data transfer speeds may be very limited, Globus can provide high bandwidth data transfers.

  - name: oscar_storage
    description: |
      Oscar storage, also known as Computational Data Storage, is a high-performance data storage system which is accessible from any computer connected from Brown's campus network, or from outside the network via ssh. What sets this option apart from the others is that it is directly connected to Brown’s primary supercomputer, “Oscar”, making computation easier. If you don’t intend to compute your data with Brown’s supercomputer, you may consider using Campus File Storage instead. You could also use Oscar storage for computing and then move your results to Campus File Storage for greater accessibility, reliability, and protection.

      - Synonyms: Oscar Data, HPC Storage, GPFS (historically) 
      - Best for: High performance storage of research data, perform computation on your data using Brown’s supercomputer
      - Limitations: Not accessible on all campus networks.
      - Rate: $100/TB/Year when storing above free/grant allocations

      [Hibernate](https://docs.ccv.brown.edu/hibernate/) is a secure, reliable, research data archive solution. Hibernate is a Brown OIT archival service for the research community to migrate inactive data off active Network-attached storage (NAS) platforms onto a lower cost, long-term retention environment. 

      * Hibernate leverages [StarFish](https://docs.ccv.brown.edu/starfish/), an application that provides a metadata and rules-based management framework for large file systems. StarFish makes storage tiering easy: moving data, reporting, zones. 
      * A zone is a virtual-volume or collection of branches across different file-systems (oscar, files22, etc.). Each PI group is distributed into an individual zone. A zone provides:
        * Types/sizes of files, access times
        * Hot Spots (Growth, user(s)/Group(s))
        * Action: Archive, Delete, Recover

    description: |
      Departmental File Services provides University departments with a location in which files can be stored, backed up, and shared across the department. The service can be accessed by mapping the drive on your computer ( [Windows Explorer](https://ithelp.brown.edu/kb/articles/connect-to-departmental-file-services-on-windows) on PC or [Finder](https://ithelp.brown.edu/kb/articles/connect-to-departmental-file-services-with-macos) on a Mac), or by visiting [webfiles.brown.edu](https://ithelp.brown.edu/kb/articles/deprecation-of-oit-s-webfiles-brown-edu-service) in a web browser. (For researchers, please check out "Campus File Storage replicated/non-replicated / Research services " section)
      
      - Best for: Backing up and sharing official department documents, ensuring longevity of documents after file authors leave Brown.
      - Limitations: Can only be accessed on the Brown network or with VPN. Not as easy to access as consumer services (no app, web access is a bit clunky).    Sharing is not easy: no sharing with people outside of Brown, no sharing with people who don't have access to the department folders.
