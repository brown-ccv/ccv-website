Hibernate is a secure, reliable, research data archive solution. Hibernate is a Brown OIT archival service for the research community to migrate inactive data off active Network-attached storage (NAS) platforms onto a lower cost, long-term retention environment.

- Hibernate leverages StarFish, an application that provides a metadata and rules-based management framework for large file systems. StarFish makes storage tiering easy: moving data, reporting, zones.
- A zone is a virtual-volume or collection of branches across different file-systems (oscar, files22, etc.). Each PI group is distributed into an individual zone. A zone provides:
        - Types/sizes of files, access times
        - Hot Spots (Growth, user(s)/Group(s)
        - Action: Archive, Delete, Recover
