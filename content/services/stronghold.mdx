<ContentSection title="Why Use Stronghold?">
Stronghold has been established by Brown University to be compatible with Federal and Rhode Island Law standards for
data privacy and protection.

Stronghold gives you flexible, ready‑to‑use workstations that run either Windows or Linux, with a standard set of tools
already installed. You can connect on campus through the university’s wireless network or from off campus using the
university’s secure remote access service. After a simple one‑time setup, your code projects can stay in sync with remote
git repositories automatically by pulling changes from your online code host into your Stronghold workspace.
