<ContentSection title="Why Use High Security Computing?">
Stronghold is a secure computing and storage environment that allows Brown researchers to analyze sensitive data while
meeting regulatory and contractual requirements. It adheres to federal and Rhode Island laws for data privacy and
protection. If you work with Level 3 Data, which includes personally identifiable information (PII) such as names,
addresses, and dates of birth, or Protected Health Information (PHI) like medical records and billing information you 
should use Stronghold. See [Brown's Data Risk Classification](https://it.brown.edu/computing-policies/risk-classifications)
for more information and examples on data risk levels.

With Stronghold, you get dedicated Windows or Linux virtual workstations that you and your collaborators
can access remotely. Workstations come with standard software packages but can be configured to fit your specific
research needs.
