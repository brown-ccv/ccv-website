<ContentSection title="Stronghold's Features">
Stronghold gives you flexible, ready‑to‑use workstations that run either Windows or Linux, with a standard set of tools
already installed. You can connect on campus through the university’s wireless network or from off campus using the
university’s secure remote access service. After a simple one‑time setup, your code projects can stay in sync with remote
git repositories automatically by pulling changes from your online code host into your Stronghold workspace.

Stronghold has access to the databases Oracle, MySQL, and REDCap allow you to manage data within Stronghold. You can
download data directly in your web browser from approved sources using the secure methods HTTPS and SFTP,
and you can securely exchange files between workstations and Box.com via FTTPS.

<ContentSection title="Data Risk Level 3 Computing">

Stronghold has been established by Brown University to be compatible with Federal and Rhode Island Law standards for data privacy and protection.

Each Principal Investigator (PI) is given a dedicated environment for their project to support their researchers,
graduate students, and collaborators. As the lead researcher for your environment, you can receive automated reports
showing who is in each security group, when users signed in, and what file transfers took place. Two separate firewalls
add an extra layer of protection for traffic going in and out of your system.

Moving data in and out is handled through a secure transfer service that scans files for viruses and allows authorized
users to exchange data with approved organizations or their own computers.
