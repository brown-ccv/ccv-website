<ContentSection id="google_drive" title="Google Drive">

Google Drive gives you space to store and share documents. The native Google document formats allow for real-time collaboration and file history. You can also store non-Google files formats in your Google Drive. It's easy to share files with members of the Brown community (including Google Groups) and non-Brown Google accounts; files can be shared with view-only, comment, or edit access.

Google also has features to convert handwritten documents to text. You can access files on the web, through a mobile app, or by installing Google Drive on your computer (which makes it act like a folder on your computer).

- Best for: Collaboration in native Google files, easy access from anywhere, small amount of total storage, sharing with Google Groups.
- Limitations: The data storage is very costly for Brown. It should not be used for large files, especially long-term. Additionally native data transfer speeds may be very slow. Globus can provide higher bandwidth data transfers from Google Drive.

<ContentSection id="globus" title="Globus">

[Globus](https://www.globus.org/data-transfer) is a secure, reliable, research data management service. With Globus, subscribers can move, share, and discover data via a single interface–whether your files live on a supercomputer, lab cluster, tape archive, public cloud or your laptop–you can manage this data from anywhere via just a web browser and using your existing identities. Transfers are facilitated through endpoints. Endpoints are data locations pointing to subscribers' specific datasets like a researcher's personal Google drive, research share or a folder on a computer.

<ContentSection id="department_file_services" title="Campus File Storage / Department File Services">

Departmental File Services provides University departments with a location in which files can be stored, backed up, and shared across the department. The service can be accessed by mapping the drive on your computer ( [Windows Explorer](https://ithelp.brown.edu/kb/articles/connect-to-departmental-file-services-on-windows) on PC or [Finder](https://ithelp.brown.edu/kb/articles/connect-to-departmental-file-services-with-macos) on a Mac). For researchers, please check out the "Campus File Storage replicated/non-replicated Research services" sections)

- Best for: Backing up and sharing official department documents, ensuring the longevity of documents after the file authors leave Brown.
- Limitations: Can only be accessed on the Brown network or with VPN. Sharing is done via Brown AD groups; no sharing with people outside of Brown.

<ContentSection id="cfs_nonreplicated" title="Campus File Storage Non-Replicated / Research Services">

File Services for Research provides Brown University research departments with a location in which files can be stored, backed up, and shared with members of the Brown community using Brown ID's and groups. Space is allocated to each research lab or PI with an ITHelp request , security groups are required to define access to the data. The data is protected locally via snapshots but doesn't have geo-redundancy (secondary copy).

- Best for: Brown faculty and staff researchers looking to store, share and protect research data.
- Accessibility: The data is accessible on Brown's campus networks (including VPN and wireless). Also accessible directly from High Performance Computing Cluster (Oscar).
- Limitations: No geo-redundancy (secondary copy)

<ContentSection id="brown_digital_repository" title="Brown Digital Repository">

The Brown Digital Repository (BDR) is a place to gather, index, store, preserve, and make available digital assets produced via the scholarly, instructional, research, and administrative activities at Brown.

The Brown University Library maintains the repository as a service to the Brown community; it provides:

- A searchable index of digital objects shared by the Brown community.
- Permanent, secure storage for personal and departmental digital objects.
- Off-site backups of digital content.
- Tools for sharing and publishing digital content.
- Data curation, format migration, and preservation services.

Faculty and researchers interested in using the Brown Digital Repository as a platform forprogrammatic data management, storage, and publication should contact the Library (bdr@brown.edu) for information about opportunities for research consulting and project development support.

<ContentSection id="oscar_storage" title="Oscar Storage">

Oscar storage, also known as Computational Data Storage, is a high-performance data storage system which is accessible from any computer connected from Brown's campus network, or from outside the network via ssh. What sets this option apart from the others is that it is directly connected to Brown's primary supercomputer, "Oscar", making computation easier. If you don't intend to compute your data with Brown's supercomputer, you may consider using Campus File Storage instead. You could also use Oscar storage for computing and then move your results to Campus File Storage for greater accessibility, reliability, and protection.

- Synonyms: Oscar Data, HPC Storage, GPFS (historically)
- Best for: High performance storage of research data, perform computation on your data using Brown's supercomputer
- Limitations: Not accessible on all campus networks.

<ContentSection id="hibernate" title="Hibernate">

[Hibernate](https://docs.ccv.brown.edu/hibernate/) is a secure, reliable, research data archive solution. Hibernate is a Brown OIT archival service for the research community to migrate inactive data off active Network-attached storage (NAS) platforms onto a lower cost, long-term retention environment.

- Hibernate leverages [StarFish](https://docs.ccv.brown.edu/starfish/), an application that provides a metadata and rules-based management framework for large file systems. StarFish makes storage tiering easy: moving data, reporting, zones.
- A zone is a virtual-volume or collection of branches across different file-systems (oscar, files22, etc.). Each PI group is distributed into an individual zone. A zone provides:
  - Types/sizes of files, access times
  - Hot Spots (Growth, user(s)/Group(s))
  - Action: Archive, Delete, Recover
