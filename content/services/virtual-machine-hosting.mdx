<ContentSection title="What is a Virtual Machine?">
Using a virtual machine on a server lets you run several separate computers inside one physical box. This means you can
get more value from the hardware that Brown already owns, cutting down on extra machines, power, and space. Each virtual
machine is walled off from the others, so if one crashes, is set up incorrectly, or gets infected, the others keep running.

You can run different operating systems and versions side by side, which helps with older software or special needs.
New machines can be created in minutes from ready‑made templates, and you can take a “picture” of a machine at a moment
in time and roll back if a change goes wrong. Many platforms let you move a running virtual machine to another physical
server to balance work or do maintenance without stopping service, and they can automatically restart machines on
healthy hardware if a server fails.

Security is improved through separate networks and rules, and it is easier to review changes and control who can do what.
This approach makes it practical to host work for different teams on the same hardware, to test new ideas safely, and
to monitor and automate day‑to‑day operations.

We support virtual machines on Windows and Linux servers. Depending on your needs, we can also
assist with basic system administration and maintenance.

We do not currently support GPUs in this environment.
