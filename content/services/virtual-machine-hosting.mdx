<ContentSection title="What is a Virtual Machine?">
A virtual machine (VM) instance is a digital version of a computer, hosted on Brown's servers, that provides
researchers with a dedicated and customizable environment. On a dedicated VM you can run a specific operating system
and install your own software without interfering with other systems or users. VMs for Windows or Linux are available
for researchers with needs not met by existing resources.

<ContentSection title="Is a VM Right for you?">
A VM may be the right choice for your research if you:

- Do not want to purchase and maintain your own hardware
- Require Windows-specific applications unavailable on your computer
- Use GUI-based software that is not compatible with available hardware
- Require persistent services and long-running tasks that cannot be hosted on other resources or platforms
- Want an isolated sandbox to develop and test software
- Need a complex software stack

A VM may not be needed if:

- Your software is able to run on our computing cluster, OSCAR
- Your long running application or website can be hosted on an alternative resource available to Brown like Kubernetes or cloud-based hosting.

VMs can be a great tool, but there are many resources at Brown that may be better alternative for your research.

are the right tool for you!
