<ContentSection title="What is a Virtual Machine?">
A virtual machine (VM) instance is a digital version of a computer, hosted on Brown's servers, that provides
researchers with a dedicated and customizable environment. On a dedicated VM you can run a specific operating system
and install your own software without interfering with other systems or users. VMs for Windows or Linux are available
for researchers with needs not met by existing resources and do not want to purchase and maintain their own hardware.

A VM may be the right choice for your research if you require:

- Windows-Specific Applications unavailable on your computer
- GUI-based software that is not compatible with running with OSCAR's Open OnDemand
- Persistent services and long-running tasks that cannot be hosted on other resources or platforms
- An isolated sandbox to develop and test software
- A complex software stack

We support virtual machines on Windows and Linux servers. Depending on your needs, we can also
assist with basic system administration and maintenance.

Request a consultation with CCV to see if VMs are the right tool for your work.
