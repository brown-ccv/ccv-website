<ContentSection title="GPUs on Oscar" id="gpus-on-oscar">

Building modern deep learning models requires specialized hardware called graphics processing units (GPUs). Originally designed 
for graphics rendering in computer games, GPUs' massively parallel architecture make them exceptionally well suited to the 
linear algebraic operations that are ubiquitous in modern deep learning models. As such, GPUs have become an essential component
of deep learning and AI. 

We have more than 800 NVIDIA GPUs on Oscar. These are available to anyone with an Oscar account. There are a wide range of GPUs on 
Oscar, from Titan RTX (24 GB VRAM) to B200 (180 GB VRAM).

<ContentSection title="Ollama" id="ollama">

Ollama is the easiest way to run large language models directly on Brown’s Oscar high‑performance computing cluster.
Available as a preinstalled module, Ollama uses a simple client–server approach: you start a server on your allocated
GPU node, then connect a second terminal as the client to chat with models or launch jobs.

We at CCV host more than 100 public, open‑weight models in a shared repository—such as Llama 4, DeepSeek‑r1, gpt‑oss, Mistral, and
Gemma3—so you don’t have to download anything; you simply point the `OLLAMA_MODELS` environment variable to CCV’s shared
path and run. We are also open to adding more models, so you can always contact us to request one!
