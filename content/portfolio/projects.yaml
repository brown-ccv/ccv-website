    image: /images/services/classroom/featured-carousel/julia.jpeg
    slug: automated-continuos-behavioral-monitoring
    description: Automated Continuous Behavioral Monitoring (ACBM) is a machine vision-based automated phenotyping method to detect and quantify the earliest-detected phenotypes in Tdp43Q331K knock-in mice. This method entails continuous video recording for 5 days that is then scored by a trained computer system. The system is a set of DL models deployed on google cloud platform using Kubeflow pipelines. Our goal is to establish sensitive, robust, objective, and open-source machine vision-based behavioral analysis tools that will be widely available to workers in the field.

    description: Autonomous Research Assistant (AutoRA) is a framework for implementing machine learning tools which autonomously and iteratively generate 1) new theories to describe real-world data, and 2) experiments to invalidate those theories and seed a new cycle of theory-making. The experiments will be run online via crowd-sourcing platforms (MTurk, Prolific).

  - title: Unsupervised cell segmentation in 3D image datasets
    image: /images/services/classroom/featured-carousel/julia.jpeg
    slug: unsupervised-cell-segmentation-3d-image-datasets
    description: An application leveraging the SwinUNetR deep learning model to detect and annotate neuronal cells in 3D confocal microscopy images. It processes spinal cord sections stained through immunohistochemistry, using four excitation channels (405nm, 488nm, 594nm, and 647nm) to identify and quantify specific neuronal populations, including DAPI-labeled total neurons, Neurod2-expressing neurons, Robo3-expressing cells, and Zfhx3-marked subsets. A preprocessing pipeline applies contrast adjustment, Gaussian filtering, and intensity-based thresholding to generate a binary mask, isolating relevant structures while filtering out background noise. Post-processing compares segmented cells with the binary mask to ensure accurate quantification and identifies co-labeled neurons across multiple stains. With GPU acceleration, the system significantly improves inference speed, enabling efficient analysis of large-scale 3D microscopy datasets.
