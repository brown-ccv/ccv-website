    description: "A dashboard that showcases the PROVIDENT model that makes predictions about which neighborhoods are at the highest risk for future overdoses. Intervention municipalities received predictions from the PROVIDENT model in the randomized trial. Organizations plan and track their interventions and their effects on the overdose data using neighborhood assessment and planning forms."

      An app that tracks the construction of particle detector modules across 4 different research institutions. The database records include information about each change, when it happened, and who made the change. Users can search the database, build modules, and upload images taken during production. The application uses a reusable component-based JavaScript frontend and deployed with a serverless cloud-based backend.

    description: |
      The Gearshift Fellowship is a car driving game where players take the role of a driver. The purpose of the game is to complete different missions and collect as many reward points as possible in the setting of 5 missions, each with different goals/challenges.

      The game is developed using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The experiment running the game and facilitating data recording is built on jsPsych, a JavaScript framework used in web-based behavioral experiments.

      It is built using Honeycomb, is an open-source template that integrates cognitive science and web development practices.
      Researchers can use it to create psychophysiological tasks which use lab equipment, for example electroencephalogram (EEG) brain measurements.
