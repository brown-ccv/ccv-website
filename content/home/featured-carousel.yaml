      CCV AI Tools provides a set of generative AI tools that are built and deployed in-house at Brown for all members of the Brown community. These tools include:

      - LibreChat (currently under construction): A unified chat interface that provides the community free and private access to a mix of state-of-the-art open-source and commercial large language models (LLMs), including GPT-5 and Gemini-2.5-Pro.
      - Transcribe: A web app that provides fast and accurate audio transcription through open-source and enterprise-level models, including the OpenAI Whisper model and Google Gemini models.
      - Ask Oscar (currently under construction): An AI assistant that can answer questions based on documentation of CCV and other Brown services.

      The Gearshift Fellowship is a car driving game where players take the role of a driver. The purpose of the game is to complete different missions and collect as many reward points as possible in the setting of 5 missions, each with different goals/challenges.

      The game is developed using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The experiment running the game and facilitating data recording is built on jsPsych, a JavaScript framework used in web-based behavioral experiments.

      It is built using Honeycomb, is an open-source template that integrates cognitive science and web development practices.
      Researchers can use it to create psychophysiological tasks which use lab equipment, for example electroencephalogram (EEG) brain measurements.

  - title: "Ice Floe Tracker"
    categories: ["Data Science", "Julia", "HPC"]
    description: |
      A tool for tracking ice floes in the arctic ocean using data from the Aqua and Terra Earth-observation satellites. 

      Researchers can use this software library to detect and find the trajectories and rotation rates of ice floes, allowing them to measure ocean currents and eddies. 
      These data are used to validate and inform ocean models as part of a larger climate research effort. 

      The IceFloeTracker.jl package is open source and written in the Julia programming language commonly used in the climate research community. 
      It includes a workflow manager to help analyze regions up to the size of the whole arctic, over decade timescales.
