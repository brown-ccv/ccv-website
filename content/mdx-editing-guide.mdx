All available components are in the `/components` folder. To make them accessible in `.mdx` files, add them to `/mdx-components.tsx`. Import the component(s) at the top of the file and add it to the Global MDX Components section at the bottom. To request a new custom component, please add an issue to the CCV website github repository.
