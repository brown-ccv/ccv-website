title: MDX Editing Guide
description: |
  A guide for getting started using MDX files to create and edit content in the CCV website.
---

<ContentSection title="What is MDX?">
  MDX files combine regular text and Markdown formatting with React components and custom components to create a feature-rich, flexible, and easy-to-use content editing experience.

  The content of the MDX Editing Guide that you are _currently reading_ is rendered from an MDX file called `mdx-editing-guide.mdx`, which you can find in the `/content` folder of the CCV website codebase. It's extremely meta.

  Every page on the CCV website is rendered from an mdx, markdown, or yaml file in the `/content` folder.

<ContentSection title="Available Components">
  All available components are in the `/components` folder. To make them accessible in `.mdx` files, add them to `/mdx-components.tsx`. Import the component(s) at the top of the file and add it to the Global MDX Components section at the bottom. To request a new custom component, please add an issue to the CCV website github repository.

  ### Best practices:

  1. **Keep it simple** - Use the styled components provided and create an issue on github to request a custom component.

  - ❌ Don't use HTML tags directly
  - ❌ Don't add complex styling or classes

  2. **Test your changes** - Run `npm run dev` to see your changes

<ContentSection title="Example MDX File">
  ### This is an example of an MDX content file containing custom components and markdown formatting.

  ```tsx
  // example-content-file.mdx
  <ContentSection title="Welcome to the Wonderful World of MDX">
  The `<ContentSection>` component is used to create a header for the page and apply styling to that page's section. It is a custom component that is defined in `/components/SectionHeader.tsx` and imported in `/mdx-components.tsx`. Every section of your page should be wrapped in a `<ContentSection>` component.

  Insert a button that links to a markdown cheat sheet and the `@next/mdx` documentation using the `<Button/>` component. It uses the same styling as the buttons that are used throughout this website. The `<ButtonGroup/>` component is used to group buttons together.

  Here is a non-exhaustive list of markdown formatting options:

  - Use dashes for bullet points
  - Like this
  - And this
  - Make a ***bold and italic*** list item
  - Make a ~~strikethrough~~ list item

  1. Make a numbered list item
  2. Like this
