<ContentSection title="What is MDX?">

MDX files combine regular text and Markdown formatting with React components and custom components to create a feature-rich, flexible, and easy-to-use content editing experience.

The content of the MDX Editing Guide that you are *currently reading* is rendered from an MDX file called `mdx-editing-guide.mdx`, which you can find in the `/content` folder of the CCV website codebase.  It's extremely meta.

Every page on the CCV website is rendered from an mdx, markdown, or yaml file in the `/content` folder.

<ContentSection title="Available Components">

All available components are in the `/components` folder. To make them accessible in `.mdx` files, add them to `/mdx-components.tsx`. Import the component(s) at the top of the file and add it to the Global MDX Components section at the bottom. To request a new custom component, please add an issue to the CCV website github repository.

### Best practices:

1. **Keep it simple** - Use the styled components provided and create an issue on github to request a custom component.
  - ❌ Don't use HTML tags directly
  - ❌ Don't add complex styling or classes
2. **Test your changes** - Run `npm run dev` to see your changes

<ContentSection title="Example MDX File">

This is an example of an MDX content file containing custom components and markdown formatting.


```tsx
<SectionHeader
  title="Welcome to the Wonderful World of MDX"
/>

The `<SectionHeader/>` component is used to create a header for the page. It is a custom component that is defined in `/components/SectionHeader.tsx` and imported in `/mdx-components.tsx`.

Insert a button that links to a markdown cheat sheet and the `@next/mdx` documentation using the `<MDXButton/>` component. It uses the same styling as the buttons that are used throughout this website.

<ButtonGroup>
  <MDXButton href="https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/">
    Markdown Cheat Sheet
  </MDXButton>
  <MDXButton href="https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/mdx">
    Read Documentation
  </MDXButton>
</ButtonGroup>

Here is a non-exhaustive list of markdown formatting options:

- Use dashes for bullet points
- Like this
- And this
- Make a ***bold and italic*** list item
- Make a ~~strikethrough~~ list item 
- Make a numbered list item
- Like this
- And this
```

This is how the above example renders:

<SectionHeader
    title="Welcome to the Wonderful World of MDX"
/>

The `<SectionHeader/>` component is used to create a header for the page. It is a custom component that is defined in `/components/SectionHeader.tsx` and imported in `/mdx-components.tsx`.
