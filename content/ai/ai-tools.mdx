<ContentSection title="Experimental Tools">
  CCV is currently developing several proof-of-concept AI tools. Ask Oscar and LibreChat are available for experimental use, though they remain in active development and may undergo changes or discontinuation. Please note that documentation may be outdated or incomplete during this development phase.

    * Ask Oscar is an AI assistant that specializes in answering questions about Oscar, Brown University's HPC cluster. It has access to Oscar's documentation to help you find the information you need.
    * LibreChat is an easy-to-use, open-source chat platform that lets you talk to multiple AI models in a private, customizable way. It's freely available to the Brown community and gives you full control over your data.
