The Center for Computation and Visualization (CCV) staff members will be available to answer questions about Brown's research computing resources (Oscar, Stronghold, Globus) and help high-performance computing (HPC) issues.

The Computational Biology Core (CBC) staff are available at office hours to provide help with experimental design, data processing pipelines, and data analysis of high-throughput sequencing data. While we specialize in computational biology, all are welcome to join us with their questions.
