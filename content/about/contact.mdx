<ContentSection title="Contact Us">

The Center for Computation and Visualization (CCV) is a center within the University's central IT organization, which is the Office of Information Technology (OIT). In addition to building and maintaining the University's hundreds of enterprise software, systems, and hardware, OIT is also responsible for driving the technological progress that enables scientific research. Executing on the University's research mission is the key role that CCV plays in OIT.

The Center for Computation and Visualization (CCV) staff members will be available to answer questions about Brown's research computing resources (Oscar, Stronghold, Globus) and help high-performance computing (HPC) issues.

The Computational Biology Core (CBC) staff are available at office hours to provide help with experimental design, data processing pipelines, and data analysis of high-throughput sequencing data. While we specialize in computational biology, all are welcome to join us with their questions.
