<ContentSection title="Grant Proposal Materials for CCV Collaborators">
  As you are preparing for a grant proposal that uses CCV resources or services, we can help provide strategic support 
  materials. 
  
  CCVâ€™s typical involvement in the grant writing process includes providing materials such as a facilities statement, 
  hardware cost estimates, standard responses, and/or personnel statements. In special circumstances, we have also 
  provided our technical expertise to write parts of or whole sections.
  
  If your research requires significant computational needs (e.g., dedicated resources), your grant will need detailed 
  hardware specifications and cost estimates. This often includes adding additional hardware integrated into Brown's 
  high-performance computing cluster to augment existing resources for your use as a [Condo account](https://docs.ccv.brown.edu/oscar/account-types#condo). 
  We work with you to you determine the right hardware and obtain necessary vendor quotes.
  
  ### Facilities Statement

  Our facilities statement details our technical expertise for reproducible research as well as our computing services. Choose sections relevant to the project and ask us for any specific needs.

<ContentSection title="Acknowledgment Statement">
  Your acknowledgment helps CCV report on our impact at Brown. Clear acknowledgments help us track the impact of our services, which in turn supports continued support for our computational resources and staff.

  If you publish research that benefited from the use of CCV services or resources, we would greatly appreciate an acknowledgment that states:

  For resources:

  > This research [Part of this research] was conducted using [computational/visualization] resources and services at the Center for Computation and Visualization, Brown University.

  For help from our research staff:

  > This work [Part of this work] was conducted with the help of research staff at the Center for Computation and Visualization, Brown University.
