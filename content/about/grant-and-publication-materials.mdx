<ContentSection title="Grant Proposal Materials for CCV Collaborators">
  As you are preparing for a grant proposal that uses CCV resources or services, we can help provide strategic support materials. 
  
  CCVâ€™s typical involvement in the grant writing process includes providing materials such as a facilities statement, standard responses, and/or a personnel statement. In special circumstances, we have also provided our technical expertise to write parts of or whole sections. 
  
  Additionally, if you are interested in purchasing hardware as part of a condo in the Oscar supercomputer, we can help you determine the right hardware for your compute needs. We can also help by obtaining quotes for hardware purchases related to condos in Oscar. 
  ### Facilities Statement

  Our facilities statement details our technical expertise for reproducible research as well as our computing services. Choose sections relevant to the project and ask us for any specific needs.
