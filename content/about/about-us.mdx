  The Center for Computation and Visualization (CCV) is a center within the
  University's central IT organization, which is the Office of Information
  Technology (OIT). In addition to building and maintaining the University's
  hundreds of enterprise software, systems, and hardware, OIT is also
  responsible for driving the technological progress that enables scientific
  research. Executing on the University's research mission is the key role that
  CCV plays in OIT.

<ContentSection title="Our Mission">
  We envision an environment where computational best practices, innovative
  solutions, and expert knowledge combine to build advanced tools for research
  and to enable new discoveries. Our mission is to provide the scientific and
  technical computing expertise required to advance computational research and
  support Brown's academic mission. In practice, this frequently means
  partnering with researchers for projects that may span weeks, months, or
  years. In some cases, these partnerships can involve researchers using grant
  funds as partial support of one of our research software engineers or data
  scientists. We have a team of data scientists and research software engineers
  with a huge variety of scientific backgrounds (e.g., Engineering, Physics,
  Computer Vision, Biology, Psychology, Statistics, Applied Math, Computer
  Science, etc.), so we can closely calibrate a person with a project.
